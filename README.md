WEBSITE MODERN ELEMENTS 

The modern website elements that I have found are from three websites. 

ELEMENTS:
-Animated image 
-Images glow when hovered over
-Image that moves around when scrolled over and moves in the opposite direction that the mouse hovers towards. The image is hidden behind a "window" oval shape so only part of the image is shown but more is revealed when it moves around.
-Top menu nav elements change colour when hovered over and also do an animation 
-Make menu stick to the top of the page when scrolling up or down
-Images move from right to left as the user scrolls up or down
-Selection of static cards that link the user to different things
-Top nav menu and display grows in size and images appear to grow into existance when the page first loads and then stay static. 

I have created several issues in this repo for future ideas and things to improve or impliment.
