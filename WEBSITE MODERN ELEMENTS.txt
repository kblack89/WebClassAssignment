WEBSITE MODERN ELEMENTS 

The modern website elements that I have found are from three websites. I shall list them below and may use all of them or some dependiong on how my website is looking.

ELEMENTS:


Done:
-Animated image 
-Images glow when hovered over
-Image that moves around when scrolled over and moves in the opposite direction that the mouse hovers towards. The image is hidden behind a "window" oval shape so only part of the image is shown but more is revealed when it moves around.
-Top menu nav elements change colour when hovered over and also do an animation 
-Make menu stick to the top of the page when scrolling up or down
-Images move from right to left as the user scrolls up or down
-Selection of static cards that link the user to different things
-Top nav menu and display grows in size and images appear to grow into existance when the page first loads and then stay static. 

Mostly done:




To do:
-Buttons move from right to left by their own in a looped cycle
-Menu gets bigger vertically as I scrolled down the page and gets thinner as I scroll back towards it
-Images and text (elements on their own as cards)that are displayed on a horizontal display and move left and right when the mouse clicks and drags them
-Round button with text around the whole shape that rotates in a clockwise motion slowly and when hovered over it spins faster for a second. The arrow in the center is always static in one direction but changes once hovered over
-Images move up or down slightly and hide the rest of the image when scrolling up or down the page
-When scrolling past a section it stops the scrolling and the text stays but the images keep moving up as the scrolling is continued. Eventually it moves past the area and keeps scrolling down
-When a section is hovered over it creates a circle shape that the mouse pointer transforms into and links the user to more content/ another page.
-A sign up to our newsletter image comes up and the page blurs out into the background
